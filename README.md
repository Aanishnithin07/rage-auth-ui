## 🎮 **THE CHALLENGE:**

This is not your typical login form. This is a **physics-based rage game** disguised as an authentication portal.
Actually i have create a algorithm in such a way that the sign-in button is impossibile to click . TRY IT NOW ! JUST TRY TO BEAT THE ALGORITHM!
**Your mission?** Simple. Just click the "SIGN IN" button.

- Space Grotesk monospace typography
- Chrome borders with metallic shimmer
- Animated particle background
- No frameworks, no dependencies, pure chaos

**Psychological Warfare**
- Button positioned where you expect it... then runs
- Speed-based taunt messages ("TOO SLOW", "WEAK", "RAGE MODE")
- Procedural audio feedback on every interaction
- Cursed Comic Sans password field
- Victory is technically possible... technically

## 🤝 **Contributing**

Want to make it even more impossible? PRs welcome!

Ideas for the masochistic:
- [ ] Add fake buttons that disappear
- [ ] Make the form fields also run away
- [ ] Add a timer that increases difficulty
- [ ] Implement "easy mode" (it's a lie)
- [ ] Add leaderboard of people who succeeded
- [ ] Integration with actual authentication (why?)
